# Vulnerability Data Dashboard

This repository contains the code that is used to develop the dashboard for the Vulnerability Data as present in [OSS Vulnerabilities Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/japkeeratsingh/oss-vulnerabilities) (FYI, I maintain this dataset and the code for the dataset generation is in [this repository](https://github.com/Japkeerat/Vulnerability-Data-Collection)).

This dashboard is developed using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), a Python library that allows you to create interactive web apps for machine learning and data science. The dashboard is hosted on [Streamlit Cloud here](https://japkeerat-vulnerability-data-dashboard-main-pob31z.streamlit.app/).

## How to run the dashboard locally
1. Clone the repository and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.
2. Run `streamlit run app.py` to run the dashboard locally.
